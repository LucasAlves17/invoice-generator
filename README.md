### Using Insomnia to test the API

To validate the endpoints I used a software called [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), you can use the `Insomnia_2023-01-24.json` from this project to import my configuration.

### Future

This project has some features to improve such as:

- improve the pdf generation, I only put the fields in line on the pdf ðŸ™ƒ;
- some fields validation, like email;
- allow updating emails only the user who created the invoice.
